1. Data Types
Write a program that, depending on the first line of the input, reads an int, double, or string.

If the data type is int, multiply the number by 2.
If the data type is real, multiply the number by 1.5 and format it to the second decimal point.
If the data type is a string, surround the input with "$".

Try to solve the problem using only one method with different overloads.
Print the result on the console.

Examples:

Input 1:
int
5

Output 1:
10

Input 2:
real
2

Output 2:
3.00

Input 3:
string
hello

Output 3:
$hello$
