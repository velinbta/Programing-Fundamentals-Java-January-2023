9. Palindrome Integers
A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward, such as 323 or 1001. Write a program that reads a positive integer number until you receive "END". For each numbered print whether the number is palindrome or not.

Examples:

Input 1:
123
323
421
121
END

Output 1:
false
true
false
true

Input 2:
32
2
232
1010
END

Output 2:
false
true
true
false
