1. Reverse Strings
You will be given a series of strings until you receive an "end" command. Write a program that reverses strings and prints each pair on a separate line in the format "{word} = {reversed word}".

Examples:

Input 1:
helLo
Softuni
bottle
end

Output 1:
helLo = oLleh
Softuni = inutfoS
bottle = elttob

Input 2:
Dog
caT
chAir
end

Output 2:
Dog = goD
caT = Tac
chAir = riAhc
