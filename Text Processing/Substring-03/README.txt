3. Substring
On the first line, you will receive a string. On the second line, you will receive a second string. Write a program that removes all of the occurrences of the first string in the second until there is no match. At the end print the remaining string.

Examples:

Input 1:
ice
kicegiciceeb

We match "ice" one more time and we get "kgiceb"
There is one more match. The final result is "kgb"
